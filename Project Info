## Specifications

- Framework for High Performance Wide Area Network (HP-WAN)

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-xhy-hpwan-framework/

- Current State of the Art for High Performance Wide Area Networks

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kcrh-hpwan-state-of-art/

 

## Project Info

1. HPWAN deployment on topologies for public networks and service scenarios based on the HP-WAN framework

2. Learn about HPWAN developments and open-source controllers and orchestrators for integrated HPWAN connection management (IETF RestConf/NetConf/YANG)

3. Integration and simulation of the HP-WAN functions, such as the rate negotiation, admission control, traffic scheduling, and resource reservations with distributed signalling  (IETF RSVP-TE)

4. Perform the CC algorithms optimizations (e.g. DCQCN algorithm) to simulate the traffic transmission with negotiated rates and compare with the HPWAN approach

5. Work on improvements to IETF protocols and models for cooperation between HPWAN domains.
